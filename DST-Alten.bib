	abstract = {Due to new regulations and further technological progress in the ﬁeld of electric vehicles, the research community faces the new challenge of incorporating the electric energy based restrictions into vehicle routing problems. One of these restrictions is the limited battery capacity which makes detours to recharging stations necessary, thus requiring eﬃcient tour planning mechanisms in order to sustain the competitiveness of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles. We introduce the Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and recharging stations (E-FSMFTW) to model decisions to be made with regards to ﬂeet composition and the actual vehicle routes including the choice of recharging times and locations. The available vehicle types diﬀer in their transport capacity, battery size and acquisition cost. Furthermore, we consider time windows at customer locations, which is a common and important constraint in real-world routing and planning problems. We solve this problem by means of branch-and-price as well as proposing a hybrid heuristic, which combines an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search with an embedded local search and labelling procedure for intensiﬁcation. By solving a newly created set of benchmark instances for the E-FSMFTW and the existing single vehicle type benchmark using an exact method as well, we show the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	title = {Tackling the rich vehicle routing problem with nature-inspired algorithms},
	abstract = {In the last decades, the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), i.e., assigning a set of orders to vehicles and planning their routes has been intensively researched. As only the assignment of order to vehicles and their routes is already an NP-complete problem, the application of these algorithms in practice often fails to take into account the constraints and restrictions that apply in real-world applications, the so called rich VRP (rVRP) and are limited to single aspects. In this work, we incorporate the main relevant real-world constraints and requirements. We propose a two-stage strategy and a Timeline algorithm for time windows and pause times, and apply a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) individually to the problem to find optimal solutions. Our evaluation of eight different problem instances against four state-of-the-art algorithms shows that our approach handles all given constraints in a reasonable time.},

A team of robots with MR-SLAM can explore an environment more efﬁciently and reliably; however, MR-SLAM also raises many challenging problems, including map fusion, unknown robot poses and scalability issues. The ﬁrst two problems can be considered as an optimization problem of ﬁnding a consistent joint map based on robots’ relative poses and sensory data. This optimization problem exhibits a similar property of a singlerobot topological/metric mapping. To exploit this property, we propose a multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) algorithm, which builds a graph-like topological map with vertices representing local metric maps and edges describing relative positions of adjacent local maps. In this MR-SLAM algorithm, the map fusion between two robots can be naturally done by adding an edge that connects two topological maps, and the estimation of relative robot pose is simply performed by optimizing this edge. For the third scalable problem, the proposed algorithm is also scalable to the number of robots and the size of an environment. Computer simulations with a public data set and experimental work on Pioneer 3-DX robots have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MR-SLAM algorithm.},

Among these methods, incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) gives an exact incremental solution to the SLAM problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to iSAM to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs. Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem and leads to an efﬁcient solution when compared to a completely global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efﬁcient access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided through iSAM, facilitating data association and loop closing. The performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets including a publicly available multi-robot data set. Further evaluation is performed in a collaborative helicopter and ground robot experiment.},

This article shows how to solve the mapping problem in the original, high-dimensional space, thereby maintaining all dependencies between neighboring cells. As a result, maps generated by our approach are often more accurate than those generated using traditional techniques.

In recent years, improvements in visual sensing capabilities, an ever-increasing focus on long-term mobile robot autonomy, and the ability to draw on state-of-the-art research in other disciplines-particularly recognition in computer vision and animal navigation in neuroscience-have all contributed to significant advances in visual place recognition systems. This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition-the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. Long-term robot operations have revealed that changing appearance can be a significant factor in visual place recognition failure; therefore, we discuss how place recognition solutions can implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally, we close with a discussion on the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid advances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding, and video description.},

Such visual SLAM system, name as collaborative visual SLAM, is different from a typical visual SLAM deployed on a single agent in that information is exchanged or shared among different agents to achieve better robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. We review the representative works on this topic proposed in the past ten years and describe the key components involved in designing such a system including collaborative pose estimation and mapping tasks, as well as the emerging topic of decentralized architecture. We believe this brief survey could be helpful to someone who are working on this topic or developing multi-agent applications, particularly micro-aerial vehicle swarm or collaborative augmented/virtual reality.

In addition, error propagation, applications, and links to publicly available code are included. VO is a well understood and established part of robotics. VO has reached a maturity that has allowed us to successfully use it for certain classes of applications: space, ground, aerial, and underwater. In the presence of loop closures, VO can be used as a building block for a complete SLAM algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for VO to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, VO has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. VO offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.},

The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

Next, we introduce QuickConnect, an anytime algorithm aiming to maximize the given metric and we show how it can merge couple of maps, as well as multiple maps at the same time. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on a fully functioning robotic system building appearance-based maps using a bag of words approach. QuickConnect outperforms alternative methods and features a convenient tradeoff between accuracy and speed.},

	abstract = {This thesis deals with the problem of localizing and controlling humanoid robots with respect to its environment, as observed by its on-board sensors. Dense visual SLAM, consisting in the simultaneous estimation of a 3D map of the environment and of the robot localization within that maps is exploited to extend and robustify multi-contact planning and control. Establishing and exploiting robot-environment contacts allows the accomplishment of both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Uncertainties in the initial robot posture, and perturbations arising from improper contact-modelling and external causes are accounted for by observing the state of the robot and its environment. A whole-body calibration method is also proposed, so that robust knowledge of the robot’s kinematic structure is known, a prerequisite to all robot-environment interaction tasks. Finally, a walking method based on model predictive control is robustiﬁed by taking into account large perturbations, and adjusting the footstep and center-of-mass trajectories accordingly to guarantee stability while accomplishing desired objectives. Several experiments on an HRP-2Kai and an HRP-4 humanoid robots are presented and discussed to illustrate and validate each of the proposed methods.},

Blackboard systems were the first at- tempt at integrating "cooperating" software modules. The goal was to achieve the flexible, brainstorming style of prob- lem solving exhibited by a group of diverse human experts working together to address problems that no single expert could solve alone. Multi-agent systems research is revisiting the collaborating-software paradigm from an agent-centric orientation. Again the goal is to achieve effective collabo- ration with a group of independent software entities, but in a way that appears to be markedly different from the approach taken in blackboard systems. In this paper, I compare and contrast these two approaches. Examining collaborating software from both perspectives pro- vides insights into the nature of collaboration, reveals unre- solved problems in integrating disparate contributions, and underscores issues in coordinating collaborative activities.},

An EKF-based single-robot SLAM is extended to multiple-robot SLAM with a novel occupancy grid map fusion algorithm. Map fusion is achieved through a multi-step process that includes image pre- processing, segmentation, cross correlation, approximating the relative transformation matrix, tuning of the transformation through the Radon image transform and similarity index, and then verification of the result using either map entropy or a verification index. Results are shown from tests performed in a real environment with multiple robotic platforms.},

Especially, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using cameras is referred to as visual SLAM (vSLAM) because it is based on visual information only. vSLAM can be used as a fundamental technology for various types of applications and has been discussed in the field of computer vision, augmented reality, and robotics in the literature. This paper aims to categorize and summarize recent vSLAM algorithms proposed in different research communities from both technical and historical points of views. Especially, we focus on vSLAM algorithms proposed mainly from 2010 to 2016 because major advance occurred in that period. The technical categories are summarized as follows: feature-based, direct, and RGB-D camera-based approaches.},

Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3)sim(3){\textbackslash}mathfrak\{sim\}(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

	abstract = {Localization is among the most important prerequisites for autonomous navigation. Vision-based systems have got great attention in recent years due to numerous camera advantages over other sensors. Reducing the computational burden of such systems is an active research area making them applicable to resource-constrained systems. This paper aims to propose and compare a fast monocular approach, named ARM-VO, with two state-of-the-art algorithms, LibViso2 and ORB-SLAM2, on Raspberry Pi 3. The approach is a sequential frame-to-frame scheme that extracts a sparse set of well-distributed features and tracks them in upcoming frames using Kanade–Lucas–Tomasi tracker. A robust model selection is used to avoid degenerate cases of fundamental matrix. Scale ambiguity is resolved by incorporating known camera height above ground. The method is open-sourced [https://github.com/zanazakaryaie/ARM-VO] and implemented in ROS mostly using NEON C intrinsics while exploiting the multi-core architecture of the CPU. Experiments on KITTI dataset showed that ARM-VO is 4–5 times faster and is the only method that can work almost real-time on Raspberry Pi 3. It achieves significantly better results than LibViso2 and is ranked second after ORB-SLAM2 in terms of accuracy.},

	abstract = {In navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. While this initially appears to be a chicken-and-egg problem there are several algorithms known for solving it, at least approximately, in tractable time for certain environments. Popular approximate solution methods include the particle filter, extended Kalman filter, Covariance intersection, and GraphSLAM.
SLAM algorithms are tailored to the available resources, hence not aimed at perfection, but at operational compliance. Published approaches are employed in self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, newer domestic robots and even inside the human body.},

The semi-direct approach eliminates the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points. Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle stateestimation in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our implementation as open-source software.},

Contrary to traditional localization algorithms, which use advanced mathematical methods to determine vehicle position, our method uses a more practical approach. In our case, an image-feature-based monocular vision technique determines only the heading of the vehicle while the vehicle’s odometry is used to estimate the distance traveled. We present a mathematical proof and experimental evidence indicating that the localization error of a robot guided by this principle is bound. The experiments demonstrate that the method can cope with variable illumination, lighting deﬁciency and both short- and long-term environment changes. This makes the method especially suitable for deployment in scenarios which require long-term autonomous operation.},

The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical ﬂow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc...

Creativity evaluation has not kept pace with system development with an evident lack of systematic evaluation of the creativity of these systems in the literature. This is partially due to difficulties in defining what it means for a computer to be creative; indeed, there is no consensus on this for human creativity, let alone its computational equivalent. This paper proposes a Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative Systems (SPECS). SPECS is a three-step process: stating what it means for a particular computational system to be creative, deriving and performing tests based on these statements. To assist this process, the paper offers a collection of key components of creativity, identified empirically from discussions of human and computational creativity. Using this approach, the SPECS methodology is demonstrated through a comparative case study evaluating computational creativity systems that improvise music.},

	abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: artiﬁcial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the ﬁeld of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely ﬁt into the standard scientiﬁc narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are ﬁxed, experiments are refocused, and one-oﬀ surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is ineﬃcient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the ﬁelds of artiﬁcial life and evolutionary computation who have provided ﬁrst-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientiﬁcally important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

	abstract = {Vehicle routing attributes are extra characteristics and decisions that complement the academic problem formulations and aim to properly account for real-life application needs. Hundreds of methods have been introduced in recent years for speciﬁc attributes, but the development of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efﬁcient and applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efﬁcient general-purpose solver. The proposed Uniﬁed Hybrid Genetic Search metaheuristic relies on problem-independent uniﬁed local search, genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem speciﬁcs are conﬁned to a limited part of the method and are addressed by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components, which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental operators to manage attribute speciﬁcities. Extensive computational experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not necessarily go against efﬁciency for these problem classes.},

In addition, it allows for the movement of goods, is distributed within urban environments, provides thousands of jobs, and supports economic growth. However, a number of issues are associated with urban freight transport, including environmental impacts, road congestion, and land use of freight facilities that conﬂicts with residential land use. Electric freight vehicles create zero emissions and provide a sustainable delivery system in comparison with conventional freight vehicles. In this study, a novel dynamic inventory routing and pricing problem under a mixed ﬂeet of electric and conventional vehicles was formulated to minimize the total travel and charging costs. The proposed model is capable of deciding on replenishment times and amounts and vehicle routes. We aimed to determine the maximum social welfare (SW) capable of providing an optimal trade-off between the supplier cost and customer delay that uses a mixed ﬂeet of vehicles. Our computational study was conducted on real data generated from a delivery dataset in Tehran. Under the proposed policy with a ﬂeet of only electric vehicles, the SW increased by 3\% while the average customer delay reduced by 15\% compared with a ﬂeet of conventional vehicles. The results show that the number of served customers and customer delay would be affected by transitioning conventional urban freight vehicles to electric vehicles. Therefore, the proposed delivery system has a signiﬁcant impact on energy savings and emissions.},

	abstract = {Due to new regulations and further technological progress in the ﬁeld of electric vehicles, the research community faces the new challenge of incorporating the electric energy based restrictions into vehicle routing problems. One of these restrictions is the limited battery capacity which makes detours to recharging stations necessary, thus requiring eﬃcient tour planning mechanisms in order to sustain the competitiveness of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles. We introduce the Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and recharging stations (E-FSMFTW) to model decisions to be made with regards to ﬂeet composition and the actual vehicle routes including the choice of recharging times and locations. The available vehicle types diﬀer in their transport capacity, battery size and acquisition cost. Furthermore, we consider time windows at customer locations, which is a common and important constraint in real-world routing and planning problems. We solve this problem by means of branch-and-price as well as proposing a hybrid heuristic, which combines an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search with an embedded local search and labelling procedure for intensiﬁcation. By solving a newly created set of benchmark instances for the E-FSMFTW and the existing single vehicle type benchmark using an exact method as well, we show the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Compared with conventional freight vehicles, electric freight vehicles create less local pollution and are thus generally perceived as a more sustainable means of goods distribution. In urban areas, such vehicles must often perform the entirety of their delivery routes without recharging. However, their energy consumption is subject to a fair amount of uncertainty, which is due to exogenous factors such as the weather and road conditions, endogenous factors such as driver behaviour, and several energy consumption parameters that are diﬃcult to measure precisely. Hence we propose a robust optimization framework to take into account these energy consumption uncertainties in the context of an electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to determine minimum cost delivery routes capable of providing strong guarantees that a given vehicle will not run out of charge during its route. We formulate the problem as a robust mixed integer linear program and solve small instances to optimality using robust optimization techniques. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase heuristic method based on large neighbourhood search to solve larger instances of the problem, and we conduct several numerical tests to assess the quality of the methodology. The computational experiments illustrate the trade-oﬀ between cost and risk, and demonstrate the inﬂuence of several parameters on best found solutions. Furthermore, our heuristic identiﬁes 42 new best solutions when tested on instances of the closely related robust capacitated vehicle routing problem.},

In this paper we extend current E-VRP models to consider nonlinear charging functions. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components speciﬁcally designed for this problem. To assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions, we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature. Our results suggest that neglecting nonlinear charging may lead to infeasible or overly expensive solutions. Furthermore, to test our hybrid metaheuristic we propose a new 120-instance testbed.

The recharging stations have a limited capacity and the newly arriving vehicles may have to queue before being recharged. In this study, we model the EVRPTW considering time-dependent queueing times at the stations. We allow but penalize late arrivals at customer locations and at the depot. We minimize the cost of vehicles, drivers, energy, and penalties for late arrivals. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solve small instances with CPLEX. For the larger instances, we develop a matheuristic which is a combination of Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search and of the solution of a mixed integer linear program. We perform an extensive experimental study to investigate the impact of queueing at the recharging stations on the routing decisions. The results show that waiting at the stations may increase the total cost by 1\% to 26\%, depending on the problem type and queue length. We also observe that recharges tend to shift to less crowded mid-day hours due to the time-dependent waiting times.},

The well-researched vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended to the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP), which takes into account specific characteristics of electric vehicles. In this paper, a literature review on recent developments regarding the E-VRP is presented. The challenges that emerged with the integration of electric vehicles in the delivery processes are described, together with electric vehicle characteristics and recent energy consumption models. Several variants of the E-VRP and related problems are observed. To cope with the new routing challenges in E-VRP, efficient VRP heuristics and metaheuristics had to be adapted. An overview of the state-of-the-art procedures for solving the E-VRP and related problems is presented.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), i.e., assigning a set of orders to vehicles and planning their routes has been intensively researched. As only the assignment of order to vehicles and their routes is already an NP-complete problem, the application of these algorithms in practice often fails to take into account the constraints and restrictions that apply in real-world applications, the so called rich VRP (rVRP) and are limited to single aspects. In this work, we incorporate the main relevant real-world constraints and requirements. We propose a two-stage strategy and a Timeline algorithm for time windows and pause times, and apply a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) individually to the problem to find optimal solutions. Our evaluation of eight different problem instances against four state-of-the-art algorithms shows that our approach handles all given constraints in a reasonable time.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Mixed Fleet (E-VRPTWMF) to optimize the routing of a mixed ﬂeet of electric commercial vehicles (ECVs) and conventional internal combustion commercial vehicles (ICCVs). Contrary to existing routing models for ECVs, which assume energy consumption to be a linear function of traveled distance, we utilize a realistic energy consumption model that incorporates speed, gradient and cargo load distribution. This is highly relevant in the context of ECVs because energy consumption determines the maximal driving range of ECVs and the recharging times at stations. To address the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm that is enhanced by a local search for intensiﬁcation. In numerical studies on newly designed E-VRPTWMF test instances, we investigate the effect of considering the actual load distribution on the structure and quality of the generated solutions. Moreover, we study the inﬂuence of different objective functions on solution attributes and on the contribution of ECVs to the overall routing costs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm on benchmark instances of the related problems VRPTW and E-VRPTW.},

In this paper, we propose a more realistic and challenging multi-objective VRP containing real-time traffic conditions. Besides, we also offer an adaptive local search algorithm combined with a dynamic constrained multi-objective evolutionary framework. In the algorithm, we design eight local search operators and select them adaptively to optimize the initial solutions. Experimental results show that our algorithm can obtain an excellent solution that satisfies the constraints of the vehicle routing problem with realtime traffic conditions.},

It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet.

Although, VRP is a research area with rich research works and powerful researchers there found only 81 articles that relates various vehicle routing type problems with various multiple objectives techniques. This author found that there is no research done in some areas of VRP (i.e., FVRP, ICVRP, LRP and CVRP). It is interesting to see that this research area was completely an unattractive to master students (with zero research reported) and a somewhat attractive area to doctoral students (with 6 researches reported). Among the many multi criterion programming techniques available only three of them (goal programming, bi-criterion programming, linear and nonlinear multi objective programming) are being employed to solve the problem.},

This research is focused on multi-objective green logistics optimization. Optimality criteria are environmental costs: minimization of amount of money paid as externality cost for noise, pollution and costs of fuel versus minimization of noise, pollution and fuel consumption themselves. Some mixed integer programming formulations of multi-criteria vehicle routing problems have been considered. Mathematical models were formulated under assumption of existence of asymmetric distance-based costs and use of homogeneous fleet. The exact solution methods are applied for finding optimal solutions. The software used to solve these models is the CPLEX solver with AMPL programming language. The researchers were able to use real data from a Spanish company of groceries. Problems deal with green logistics for routes crossing the Spanish regions of Navarre, Basque Country and La Rioja. Analyses of obtained results could help logistics managers to lead the initiative in area of green logistics by saving money paid for environmental costs as well as direct cost of fuel and minimization of pollution and noise.},
